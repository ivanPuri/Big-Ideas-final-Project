I focused on the metric that showed the % of cars or bikes that went by that intersection above the speed limit. I then took the average for all of the locations for each neighborhood in order to get the average % of cars that speed per neighborhood. This way I could quantify the best neighborhood as the safest due to the fact that it is the one where most people are following road laws. I displayed it on a graph in decending order so it would also be easy to see"
